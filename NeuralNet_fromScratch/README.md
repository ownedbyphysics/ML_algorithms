Understanding the fundamentals: Implementing a neural network from scratch is a way to help understand the underlying principles and mathematics involved in machine learning and neural networks. 
I am using MNIST dataset (Train set) to train a neural network only using numpy. 
The two images below depict the concept and the strategy followed.
